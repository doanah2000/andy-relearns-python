1. Simple Assignment
Simple Assignment never copies data. When an old variable is assigned to a new variable, both variables refer to the
same object. Any changes made using one variable will be reflected in the other variable.

ex:
>>> rgb = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
>>> rgba = rgb
>>> id(rgb) == id(rgba) # This is True
>>> rgba.append("Alph")
>>> rgb == ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alph"]

2. id()
The `id()` function returns a unique id for a specified object. This id is assigned to the object when the object is
created, and is the object''s memory address. This id will be different each time a program is run, with the exception
of objects with a constant unique id (ex: integers from -5 to 256)

ex:
>>> a = 1 # 4377864496
>>> b = 2 # 4377864528
>>> c = b # 4377864528 same as b, playing off of simple assignment

3. len()
Returns the number of items in an object. The argument may be a sequence(string, bytes, tuple, list, range) or a
collection (dictionary, set, frozen set)

3. Tricky Slicing
When slicing an iterable, the new object follows the lower-bound inclusive and upper-bound exclusive pattern
ex:
>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>> squares[0:2] # returns [1, 4], element at the lower bound (index 0) is included up to element right before the
upper bound (index 1), excluding element at upper bound (index 2)

4. sorted(iterable, /, **, key=None, reverse=False)
Returns a new sorted list from the items in iterable.
- key specifies a function off one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in it.
  (ex: str.lower). Use functools.cmp_to_key() to convert an old-style cmp function to a key function
